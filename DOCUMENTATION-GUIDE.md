## Documentation Principles

Our documentation follows these principles:

### Progressive Disclosure
Start simple, reveal complexity as needed. The Showcase starts with basic buttons before showing complex layouts.

### Learn by Example
Every feature has a working example. Copy, paste, and modify to learn.

### Multiple Formats
Some people learn by reading (Guide), others by doing (Showcase), others by reference (Quick Reference).

### Just-in-Time Help
FAQ answers questions when you're stuck. Quick Reference helps when you forget syntax.

### Searchability
All docs are markdown and searchable. Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F to find what you need.

## Tips for Using Documentation

### Bookmark These Three
1. [Syntax Showcase](examples/showcase.md) - Your main reference
2. [Quick Reference](QUICK-REFERENCE.md) - Fast syntax lookups
3. [FAQ](FAQ.md) - When things go wrong

### Use Browser Search
All documentation is text-based. Use your browser's search (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F) to quickly find specific components or syntax.

### Keep Examples Handy
The [examples/](examples/) folder has working wiremd files you can:
- Copy as starting templates
- Modify for your needs
- Use to test different visual styles

### Start with Working Code
When stuck, start with a working example from the Showcase and modify it incrementally until it matches your needs.

### Read the Error Messages
The parser provides helpful error messages. Read them carefully - they often tell you exactly what's wrong.
